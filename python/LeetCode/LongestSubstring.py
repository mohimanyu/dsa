# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


# Constraints:

# 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
# s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

        charSet = set()
        maxLen = 0
        left = 0

        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[left])
                left += 1

            charSet.add(s[right])
            maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1)

        return maxLen
